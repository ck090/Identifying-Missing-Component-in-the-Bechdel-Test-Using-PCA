The sentiment on iPhone’s call quality is positive, but the sentiment on its battery life is negative. (Liu 2012)\n"

      "i don't think it's abuse, i think it's torture.\n",
      "so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital\n",
      "officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!\n",
      "my little sister and i shared a flat - i came home one night and a man was raping her.  his gun was on the chair he came at me and i shot him.\n",
      "alright.  that's a justifiable homicide.\n",
      "yes, but he was a cop.\n",
      "now i become custody of police department?\n",
      "if you cooperate with the da - maybe they'll help you with your situation.\n",
      "i will if they don't send me back.\n",
      "they won't until this is over.\n",
      "are you married?\n",
      "divorced.\n",
      "do you live alone?  i've been in these clothes sincethe killings.  could we stop at your place? i could take a showerbefore i go into custody?\n",
      "i can't take you to my place.\n",
      "somewhere else?\n",
      "the men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.\n",
      "sothe station is empty?\n",
      "yeah.  this way.\n",
      "you considered becoming a prostitute?\n",
      "yes, i considered it.\n",
      "did you ever turn tricks before?\n",
      "no.\n",
      "what about back home?\n",
      "no.\n",
      "i came here.  i had no money.  i knew no one.  i couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. they approached me - i could've made a lot of money.  i considered it, but it's not who i am.  they pay me below the table at ludwig's.\n",
      "so you were never a prostitute?\n",
      "what are you asking me?\n",
      "i'm just trying to find out who you are.\n",
      "i'm not a whore.  i'm not a whore.\n",
      "i know.\n",
      "you don't know.  i'm sorry.  i was desperate.  that's not me.  i shot a cop.  can you imagine what they'll do to me when i got to prison?\n",
      "they're not gonna send you right back.\n",
      "i'm sorry.  i didn't mean toi'm glad. actually i'm glad it's over.  all this time.  hiding.  never being able to look anyone in the eyes. always afraid that someone would find out who i was.  never trusting anyone\n",
      "are you alright?\n",
      "i still can't believe eddie's gone.\n",
      "i'm sorry.\n",
      "is he your boyfriend?\n",
      "ludwig?  he's gay - are you jealous?\n",
      "if i was your boyfriend, i might be.\n",
      "if you were my boyfriend, i'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.\n",
      "a good immigration lawyer could stall the process.  eddie recommended one.\n",
      "no matter what happensi'm glad i met you.\n",
      "i'm glad i met you.\n",
      "you better get packed.\n",
      "right.\n",
      "do you have coffee?\n",
      "in the kitchen.\n",
      "i'll make some for us.\n",
      "i'll get my clothes.\n",
      "what are you doing?\n",
      "pouring it out!\n",
      "forget about me.  you have enough problems of your own.\n",
      "do you really want me to forget about you?\n",
      "i don't want to drag you down with me.\n",
      "daphne, i\n",
      "i told your partner, i can't help.  i didn't see anything.\n",
      "c'mon, start at the beginning.  you know these people?\n",
      "tamina was a friend of mine.  my shower was broken, she let me use theirs.\n",
      "go on.\n",
      "whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  better if it comes from you.\n",
      "if i tell you, will you arrest me?\n",
      "arrest you for what?  why would we arrest you?\n",
      "are you here illegally?  don't worry about that.  we'll talk to immigration. they won't deport you.\n",
      "no, no, don't talk to immigration!\n",
      "a cop?\n",
      "i'm from a small town in slovakia.  like the south here.  the police is right, a civilian is wrong.  so i fled.\n",
      "look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. tell us the truthis that the truth?\n",
      "you're a cop - you'll never believe me.\n",
      "oh.\n",
      "it was my decision, not his.\n",
      "well, i'm the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i'd like to be included in decisions.\n",
      "look, after jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  how about that? the case is all yours.\n",
      "oh yeah?  alright.\n",
      "i'm ready to be briefed.  excuse us.\n",
      "yeah, sure.  beep me when you're ready for the press conference.\n",
      "who did cause and origin?\n",
      "who do you think, chief?!\n",
      "then why didn't you talk to the reporter?\n",
      "'cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.\n",
      "hey, chief, what are you doing here?\n",
      "i came to see how the investigation was going.  i called and you're not here.  i wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  i beep you - you don't return my call.  where the hell have you been?!\n",
      "ladder 20 was on the rock for training. we stopped there so she could get cleaned up.\n",
      "what do you mean, 'cleaned up?'\n",
      "i let her take a shower.\n",
      "a shower!?  did you take one, too?\n",
      "no!  nothing happened.\n",
      "oh really.  that's nice.  you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  are you out of your fucking mind??  are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!\n",
      "chief - mind if i take her?\n",
      "okay.  but not water sports.\n",
      "the public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  this is going to be our rodney king!\n",
      "what was i supposed to do?  the guy tried to mug me.  i was gonna send a cop back - i just forgot.\n",
      "forgot?  you handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!\n",
      "chief - i know i screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.\n",
      "well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.\n",
      "end my career?\n",
      "how are you going to fight this?  maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  you'd have the good to weight against the bad! it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do!  gimme your shield.\n",
      "but chief?  over this??\n",
      "there's nothing to talk about.  get a good lawyer.  you're suspended until your trial.\n",
      "don't you guys understand?  it's all about image.  the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime.\n",
      "yeah, right.\n",
      "what was that, korfin?\n",
      "i said, yeah, you're right, chief.  as soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.\n",
      "you do that, wiseguy.  now let's solve this thing before eddie flemming does.\n",
      "did the d.a. videotape her deposition?\n",
      "yeah.  he finished awhile ago.\n",
      "alright.  swing by her apartment.  let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street.  you got that?\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "coffee for me, i gotta slow down.\n",
      "vodka tonic.\n",
      "maybe you could just put in a shot of martell?\n",
      "it was freaky, i'll tell you.  stupid kid.\n",
      "what's the kid gonna say - sorry? meanwhile i'm not here anymore. like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  who knows?  but some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and i'm thinkin' that's me. sooner or later.  that's me.\n",
      "i'm gonna propose.\n",
      "when?\n",
      "tomorrow.  at lunch.\n",
      "you ready?\n",
      "what's he looking for?\n",
      "a timer.\n",
      "where is she?\n",
      "takin' a bath.\n",
      "any i.d.?\n",
      "still unknown but we're running prints. kid over there caught the case.\n",
      "sorrypd only.\n",
      "it's okay.\n",
      "only one guys checked in?\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "c'mere.  you wanna go to homicide school?  here - make yourself useful.\n",
      "the other side of the street.  the guy with the videocamera.  don't look - put her in the car.  stay this side.\n",
      "stay with her.\n",
      "are you hit?\n",
      "no.  i'm okay.\n",
      "he got my gun!  motherfucker was filming the whole time!\n",
      "i know.  relax.  take it easy.  don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.\n",
      "who's there?\n",
      "police.  we'd like to ask you a few questions.\n",
      "i have nothin' to say.  if you wanna contact my attorney\n",
      "homicide, miss hearn.  it's detective eddie flemming.  open up.\n",
      "what's wrong?\n",
      "we don't have her i.d. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel.\n",
      "oh my g-d.  honey!  honey's dead?\n",
      "yeah.  he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia, but i sent him honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - honey was killed?  poor girl\n",
      "do you have any czech girls working for you?\n",
      "no.\n",
      "did you tell him you did?\n",
      "boy, she's so popular all the sudden.\n",
      "what are you saying?\n",
      "daphne.  another guy came in asking me about her, too.\n",
      "he said he was her cousin.  i told him where she works.  they were just here.\n",
      "describe him.\n",
      "tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  second guy with him wasshorter, with a wrestler's build.  and he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.\n",
      "he had a videocamera?  where is she? quickly!\n",
      "she washes hair up at ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and madison.\n",
      "hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  it gives us somethin' to do.\n",
      "no, we don't mind.  you mind leon?\n",
      "you know what that is, right?\n",
      "no, what is it?\n",
      "why don't you explain it, bobby.  hey camello!  you mind punching a hole in the floor?\n",
      "it's your crime scene now.  you can do what you want.\n",
      "watch the news?\n",
      "nah, i musta missed it.\n",
      "well, just so you know.  i gave you guys the credit.\n",
      "well, just so you know, i don't care about that stuff.\n",
      "nah, why should you?\n",
      "i don't even watch tv.\n",
      "good.  good.  commendable.\n",
      "did you get a report from the m.e.?\n",
      "sure.  but i would like to ask you something.  you got a problem with me?\n",
      "if you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  what about the report?\n",
      "you were right, they were both dead before the fire.  the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  that's usually an indicator of something personal.\n",
      "the super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.\n",
      "pretty.\n",
      "hmmmm.\n",
      "maybe you don't care about that either.  prettiest suspect i've had in awhile.\n",
      "who says she's a suspect?\n",
      "what would you call her?\n",
      "look, i'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  i saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. maybe she saw something.  maybe she was visiting somebody here.  who knows?\n",
      "maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe.  it could be to humiliate them. just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.\n",
      "eastern europe.  like what?  romania? hungary?\n",
      "or czechoslovakia.  the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years.  these are very intense people and they take things personally.\n",
      "i'll come with you.\n",
      "there wasn't a fire.  there'll be nothing for you to do.\n",
      "i can watch you, eddie.  maybe i'll learn something.\n",
      "this isn't homicide school.\n",
      "my parents are from poland.  i can help with the eastern european angle.\n",
      "you're polish?\n",
      "my folks are.\n",
      "stay here.\n",
      "you goin' to the escort service?\n",
      "you got any better ideas?\n",
      "mind if i ride along with you?\n",
      "this has nothing to do with your fire.\n",
      "but what if it does?  you might need my help.\n",
      "i'll let you know what happens.\n",
      "this is ridiculous.  i'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.\n",
      "tell you what - i'll flip you a coin. if you win you can come with me.  if you don't win, you don't come.\n",
      "i'll call it tails.\n",
      "two heads.\n",
      "better than one.\n",
      "leon - meet us at 63rd and madison. hair salon.  ludwig's.\n",
      "i'm on my way with eddie.  ludwig's. 63rd and madison.  the suspects might be there already.\n",
      "you thirsty?\n",
      "i'm on duty.\n",
      "so am i.  alright, i'll go inside and you cover the back.\n",
      "of course.\n",
      "hey!  i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid.  i dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'freeze!' at the bad guy! what'd you dream about?\n",
      "i wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.\n",
      "then i guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  if we pull up to a burning building i'll gladly let you go first.\n",
      "what are you hiding?  why are you afraid\n",
      "she just saw two of her friends killed! they probably threatened her.\n",
      "is that all there is?\n",
      "why not?\n",
      "something back home?\n",
      "she's fucked.  even if that story is true.\n",
      "raw deal.\n",
      "look - let me talk to her.  any leads i get, they're all yours.  just let me have a first crack at her.\n",
      "you wanna talk to her alone?\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "what would your girlfriend think of that?\n",
      "i don't have a girlfriend.\n",
      "my point exactly.\n",
      "i'm serious here.\n",
      "so am i.\n",
      "c'mon.  you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  she sees me differently.\n",
      "you're her savior?  is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?\n",
      "you know what i'm saying here.\n",
      "okay, tell you what, i'll give you a head start.  you take her to the station house.  don't let her out of your sight. she's the only warm body we got left.\n",
      "hey.  i'm a professional.\n",
      "women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.\n",
      "look, eddie, i'm tellin' you - i didn't touch her.\n",
      "well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn'tincluding me.\n",
      "i took her there for a shower and that's it.\n",
      "just a shower?\n",
      "yeah, just her in the shower.  nothing happened.  look, i'm sure you probably think i'm a fool and i fucked up, but\n",
      "no, i don't think you were a fool, i just think you were stupid about it.  i mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  you don't know her well enough. she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  you can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. you're dead.\n",
      "i told you, you know, i thought i was doing the right thing, you know, i think she's innocent.\n",
      "well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.\n",
      "but, i mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  i mean, you shoulda heard her there.  tellin' her whole storyi believed her.\n",
      "how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer.  here, here's a number of an immigration lawyer.  that's how you help her. but you can't get involved in her like that.  you're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  and lemme give you another piece of advice.  maybe you don't watch tv but i'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  and when you get out there, they know your face.  and the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  and i get more done because of it.\n",
      "why'd you help me back there with the chief?  why'd you stand up for me like that?\n",
      "you know, i don't know.  i like you. you remind me of a puppy i used to have. he pissed on the rug all the time, but i still kept him.\n",
      "sowho's nicky?\n",
      "what do you want?\n",
      "your opinion.  you see, they going to make a movie about me, too, eddie.  and write books.\n",
      "what's your accomplishment.\n",
      "i kill someone famous.\n",
      "then do it, asshole.\n",
      "good - be tough to the end.  actor who plays you will want to die like hero.\n",
      "so tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  they going to have real movie this time.\n",
      "if you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.\n",
      "you really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  how fuckin' stupid are you?\n",
      "smarter than americans.  you're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  not only will americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  sodetective eddie flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette? maybe you can propose to her now?\n",
      "detective, does it look like a murder?\n",
      "we don't know that yet.  it's much too early.  there's a lot to be done.\n",
      "how many victims are up there?\n",
      "there are two bodies found at this point.\n",
      "can we go up to the crime scene?\n",
      "you know you can't do that.  c'mon.\n",
      "is it drug related?\n",
      "we don't know.  when i have more i'll let you know.\n",
      "detective - can you tell us what happened here?\n",
      "i can't talk right now.  we have some things to take care of.\n",
      "i understand, but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you.  is this somehow related to the fire department?\n",
      "i really can't give out any information right now at this point.\n",
      "okay.  but i do understand that your partner, leon jackson's been injured. is that correct?\n",
      "he was hurt, but not seriously.  he'll be fine.\n",
      "do you have the suspect in custody?\n",
      "umnow is not a good time, okay. detective jackson's hurt.  he's fine. i've got a fire marshall shot, detective jackson is hurt but not seriously.\n",
      "alright, cut, cut, cut.\n",
      "eddie, are you okay?\n",
      "yeah.  now's not a good time.\n",
      "alright.\n",

      "alright.\n",
      "alright.\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "hey, honey.\n",
      "hey.\n",
      "what is your problem?  why'd you snap at me?  i just wanted a statement.\n",
      "i can'ti can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!\n",
      "you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  you could give me something.\n",
      "oh, i'm sorry.  did i embarrass you, sweetheart?  oh\n",
      "stop it.\n",
      "maybe i should just, ya knowturn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?\n",
      "alright, alright, eddie.  don't patronize me.\n",
      "i'm not.\n",
      "yes you are.  i'm not just some reporter.  i don't just stick a microphone in your face.  you could give me something.\n",
      "yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  that was\n",
      "that was good.  you were holding the evidence.\n",
      "you were merciless.  you didn't give a shit if you got me or not.\n",
      "well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  huh?\n",
      "you're ruthless.\n",
      "you're not so bad yourself.\n",
      "look at this.  you have blood on your shirt.  whose is it?\n",
      "could be leon's.\n",
      "jesus.  and last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  what am i going to do with you?\n",

    "Sentiment analysis is simply the process of working out (statistically) whether a piece of text is positive, negative or neutral. <br> The majority of sentiment analysis approaches take one of two forms: polarity-based, where pieces of texts are classified as either positive or negative, or valence-based, where the intensity of the sentiment is taken into account. <br>For example, the words ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ would be treated the same in a polarity-based approach, whereas ‘excellent’ would be treated as more positive than ‘good’ in a valence-based approach. <br> \n",

    "VADER belongs to a type of sentiment analysis that is based on lexicons of sentiment-related words.<br>In this approach, each of the words in the lexicon is rated as to whether it is positive or negative, and in many cases, how positive or negative.<br>"
